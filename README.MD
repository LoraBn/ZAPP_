## Introduction
This mobile application is built using React Native and consists of both frontend and backend components. Before running the app locally, make sure you have set up the React Native environment and installed all the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project and install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
     ```bash
     # Install frontend dependencies
     cd frontend
     npm install
     
     # Install backend dependencies
     cd ../backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Running the Backend:**
   - From the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Running the Frontend:**
   - Open another terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
